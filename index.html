            <p>
                <strong>Chandler Guo was a pioneer in cryptocurrency, the digital currencies that can<br> be created and 
                used independently of national central banks and<br> governments.</strong>
            </p>   
            <p>
                In 2014 he set up an operation to produce one of those currencies, Bitcoin, in a<br>secret location in 
                western China.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Mining" Bitcoin is a power hungry enterprise involving dozens of computers so he<br> used power from a 
                hydroelectric station, in partnership with a local Chinese<br> government official.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its peak his machines were capable of mining 30% of the world's Bitcoin. He believed<br> Bitcoin 
                would one day change the world and replace the dollar.
            </p>
            <p>
                But now he sees a new force emerging - a payment system created by the Chinese<br> state and known as 
                Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP).
            </p>
            <p>
                It's really a digital version of China's official currency, the yuan, and Mr Guo feels<br>DCEP will 
                become the dominant global currency."One day everyone in the world<br>will be using DCEP," he says.
            </p>
            <p>
                "<abbr title="Digital Currency Electronic Payment">DCEP</abbr> will be successful because there are a 
                lot of Chinese people living outside<br> of China - there are 39 million Chinese living outside of the 
                country.<br>"If they have a connection with China they will use the DCEP. They can make<br>DCEP become 
                an international currency."
            </p>
            <p>
                But many question whether it will succeed and there are concerns that it will be<br>used by Beijing to 
                spy on citizens.

                Like Bitcoin,<abbr title="Digital Currency Electronic Payment">DCEP</abbr> 
                <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51281233">utilises a blockchain technology</a>, a type of 
                digitised ledger<br> used to verify transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blockchain acts as a universal record of every transaction ever made on that<br>network, and users 
                collaborate to verify new transactions when they occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice, that means users don't need a bank if, for example, they want to pay<br>each other, 
                perhaps with their phones.
            </p>
            <p>
                China plans to launch DCEP later this year. But so far, the People's Bank of China<br>has not given an 
                exact date for the nationwide launch.
            </p>
            <p>
                China began testing the digital currency earlier this year in selected cities. When<br>rolled out it 
                will allow users to link downloaded electronic wallets to their bank<br>cards, make transactions and 
                transfer money.

            <p>
                "It's hard to predict the timeline but the People's Bank of China is under a lot of<br> 
                pressure to accelerate the development because they do not want to be in a world<br>where Libra 
                <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51730772">(Facebook's digital currency)</a> becomes the 
                global currency, which<br> they think is worse than the current global financial system controlled by 
                the US,"<br>says Linghao Bao, an analyst from Beijing-based Trivium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Observers say China wants to internationalise the yuan so that it can compete with<br>the dollar.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Chinese government believes that if some other countries can also use the <br>Chinese currency it 
                can break the United States' monetary sovereignty. The United<br>States has built the current global 
                financial system and the instruments," says an<br>anonymous Chinese cryptocurrency observer known as 
                Bitfool.
            </p>

                The technology enthusiast worked in the venture capital sector before joining a<br>number of Chinese 
                internet companies. He started researching Bitcoin and<br>believes that digital currencies represent 
                the future of money.
