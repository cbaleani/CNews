            <p>
                <strong>Chandler Guo was a pioneer in cryptocurrency, the digital currencies that can<br>be created and 
                used independently of national central banks and<br>governments.</strong>
            </p>   
            <p>
                In 2014 he set up an operation to produce one of those currencies, Bitcoin, in a<br>secret location in 
                western China.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Mining" Bitcoin is a power hungry enterprise involving dozens of computers so he<br>used power from a 
                hydroelectric station, in partnership with a local Chinese<br>government official.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its peak his machines were capable of mining 30% of the world's Bitcoin. He believed<br>Bitcoin 
                would one day change the world and replace the dollar.
            </p>
            <p>
                But now he sees a new force emerging - a payment system created by the Chinese<br>state and known as 
                Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP).
            </p>
            <p>
                It's really a digital version of China's official currency, the yuan, and Mr Guo feels<br>DCEP will 
                become the dominant global currency."One day everyone in the world<br>will be using DCEP," he says.
            </p>
            <p>
                "<abbr title="Digital Currency Electronic Payment">DCEP</abbr> will be successful because there are a 
                lot of Chinese people living outside<br>of China - there are 39 million Chinese living outside of the 
                country.<br>"If they have a connection with China they will use the DCEP. They can make<br>DCEP become 
                an international currency."
            </p>
            <p>
                But many question whether it will succeed and there are concerns that it will be<br>used by Beijing to 
                spy on citizens.
            </p>

                Like Bitcoin,<abbr title="Digital Currency Electronic Payment">DCEP</abbr> 
                <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51281233">utilises a blockchain technology</a>, a type of 
                digitised ledger<br>used to verify transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blockchain acts as a universal record of every transaction ever made on that<br>network, and users 
                collaborate to verify new transactions when they occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice, that means users don't need a bank if, for example, they want to pay<br>each other, 
                perhaps with their phones.
            </p>
            <p>
                China plans to launch DCEP later this year. But so far, the People's Bank of China<br>has not given an 
                exact date for the nationwide launch.
            </p>
            <p>
                China began testing the digital currency earlier this year in selected cities. When<br>rolled out it 
                will allow users to link downloaded electronic wallets to their bank<br>cards, make transactions and 
                transfer money.

                "It's hard to predict the timeline but the People's Bank of China is under a lot of<br>pressure to 
                accelerate the development because they do not want to be in a world<br>where Libra 
                <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51730772">(Facebook's digital currency)</a> becomes the 
                global currency, which<br>they think is worse than the current global financial system controlled by 
                the US,"<br>says Linghao Bao, an analyst from Beijing-based Trivium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Observers say China wants to internationalise the yuan so that it can compete with<br>the dollar.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Chinese government believes that if some other countries can also use the<br>Chinese currency it 
                can break the United States' monetary sovereignty. The United<br>States has built the current global 
                financial system and the instruments," says an<br>anonymous Chinese cryptocurrency observer known as 
                Bitfool.
            </p>
            <p>
                The technology enthusiast worked in the venture capital sector before joining a<br>number of Chinese 
                internet companies. He started researching Bitcoin and<br>believes that digital currencies represent 
                the future of money.

                "Some traditional banking systems can't serve a poor country. In the traditional<br>system, if you only 
                 have $10 a bank can't make money from you, but with digital<br>currency, everyone has the right to 
                 enter. The threshold to enter is really low," he<br>says.

                Although Facebook has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51730772">scaled back its plans for Libra</a>, 
                it was still a concern for<br>China. The social media giant plans to roll out an e-wallet known as Novi 
                later this<br>year. It will work as a standalone app but can also be available on Messenger and<br>WhatsApp.

                "The two sides are definitely involved in financial warfare even though no large<br>confrontation has 
                happened yet," says Linghao Bao.
            </p>
            <p>
                Observers like Bitfool believe that China is already further ahead of the US in the<br>battle for the 
                future of money.
            </p>
            <p>
                China's digital payment systems are widely seen as the most advanced in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The country is on the verge of becoming a cashless society. In 2019, four out of<br>every five payments 
                in China were made through either Tencent's WeChat Pay or<br>Alibaba's Alipay.

            </figure>
            <p>
                "America is the leader of the global financial system. But they don't have the<br>motivation like China 
                to make the change [to a digital currency]," says Bitfool.
            </p>
            <p>
                "China wants to share that power. But for America, Libra is just a backup plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                "In poor countries and also in China there are a lot of people who live in villages.<br>They have very 
                little money but they are using smartphones. If you can buy a<br>smartphone you can use 
                <abbr title="Digital Currency Electronic Payment">DCEP</abbr>."
            </p>
            <p>
                However, DCEP will be centralised and state-run, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum which<br>are free of state 
                control.
